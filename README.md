# Chem-E-Cross

This is the legacy site for Chem-E-Cross, a monthly crossword series based on chemical engineering concepts organized by AZeotropy, IIT Bombay. The 2021-22 edition of the competition had a total prize fund of INR 15,000 and was open to all undergraduate students across India. 

The portal for the latest edition can be found [here](https://azeotropy-iitb.github.io/chem-e-cross/). I no longer maintain the site, nor am I associated with the organizers in any capacity.
